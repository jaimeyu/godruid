  MetaFilter:
    description: >
      An object that allows filtering on arbitrary metadata criteria and their values. 
      The keys in the map are associated with metadata categories and the value array 
      corresponds to a set of whitelist filter-in values for that category. The logical 
      semantics associated with this structure are conditional-AND across metadata
      criteria (keys) and conditional-OR across the values contained within the value
      array. For example, {"region":["montreal","ottawa"], "group":["radio"]} will match
      all records that are of group "radio" AND from the region "montreal" OR "ottawa"
    type: object
    example: {"region":["montreal","ottawa"], "group":["radio"]}

      type: array
      items:
        type: string
  
  DimensionFilter:
    description: >
      An object that allows filtering on dimensions tracked against metric records during ingestion.
      The keys in the map are associated with the dimension name and the value array corresponds
      to a set of whitelist filter-in values for that dimension. The logical 
      semantics associated with this structure are conditional-AND across dimensions
      (keys) and conditional-OR across the values contained within the value
      array. For example, {"firmware":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1"], "state":["active"]} will match
      all records that have a state of "active" AND with firmware versions "v1.0.0" OR "v1.0.1"
    type: object
    example: {"firmware":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1"], "state":["active"]}
