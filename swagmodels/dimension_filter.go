// DimensionFilter An object that allows filtering on dimensions tracked against metric records during ingestion. The keys in the map are associated with the dimension name and the value array corresponds to a set of whitelist filter-in values for that dimension. The logical  semantics associated with this structure are conditional-AND across dimensions (keys) and conditional-OR across the values contained within the value array. For example, {"firmware":["v1.0.0","v1.0.1"], "state":["active"]} will match all records that have a state of "active" AND with firmware versions "v1.0.0" OR "v1.0.1"
